\section{Introduction}\label{sec:fpintro}

The goal of this is to put forth a draft document so we can agree on a
syntax and semantics for floating-point in ACSL. The goals of this
syntax should be, in decreasing priority:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Support specification of compositional floating-point error analysis
	\item Be as simple as possible
	\item Allow straightforward translation to multiple floating-point automated reasoning tools
	\item Be as similar as possible to existing FP syntax in ACSL
\end{enumerate}

The proposed syntax and semantics is based on Section 2.2.5 of the Frama-C ACSL
Implementation, version 1.20 (Implementation in Frama-C version 29.0).

\section{Features}

To support floating-point analysis in ACSL, we recommend five main features. These are in decreasing order of priority, where the first two are necessary for compositional floating-point error analysis while the others improve usability and compatibility.

\begin{enumerate}

\itembf \lstinline|\round_error| predicate. This is mentioned in the Frama-C ACSL implementation~\cite[\S.~2.2.5]{cea:2024:acsl}, but has limited support in the WP plug-in.

\itembf \verb|\uncertainty| predicate. This allows to model sources of error external to Frama-C; i.e., from physical phenomena or other analysis from external tools. For example,

    \begin{listing-nonumber}
    /*@ requires 0.0 <= x <= 1000.0;
        requires \uncertainty(x,-5.0,5.0); */
    \end{listing-nonumber}

\item
\lstinline|real numerics| and \lstinline|floating numerics| to have local syntax, as opposed to a global description via \verb|-wp-model +real| or \verb|-wp-model +float|.
\todo{SP: The Frama-C source I looked it made it seem like this was possible since the WP model was often looked up per-function - could this apply per-block of ACSL easily?}

\item \lstinline|lower < x < upper| implies \lstinline|\is_finite(x)|, to simplify specifications.
\item \lstinline|\ulp(x)| to represent the unit in the last place. There are multiple definitions of $\ulp$~\cite{muller:2005:ulp}, with slightly different properties between each of them~\cite{muller:2018:handbook}; we use the one chosen by ReFlow:

      % logic real ulp_dp(real x) =
      % (x == 0) ? \pow(BASE, (\emin_dp - p_dp + 1))
      % : \pow(BASE, (\max(\floor(\log(\abs(x))/\log(2)), \emin_dp) - p_dp + 1));`
    \[
        \ulp(x) = \begin{cases}
            2^{\emin - p + 1}                                   & \text{ if } x = 0 \\
            2^{\max(\lfloor \log_2(|x|)\rfloor, \emin) - p + 1} & \text{ otherwise}
        \end{cases}
    \]
    where $p$, $\emin$ depend on the floating-point precision.
	For single precision, $\emin = -126$, $p = 24$.
	For double precision, $\emin = -1022$ and $p = 53$.
	\todo{SP: Do we even want to define ulp, or leave it implementation defined?}

\end{enumerate}

\section{Implementation}

This section describes considerations for how these features could be implemented.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Modify existing Why3 drivers with ReFlow~\cite{ferreira:2023:reflow} to work more easily with Frama-C.
	\item Translating from PVS to a common ACSL syntax.
	\item Translating from the common ACSL syntax to PVS: this should be relatively easily accomplished using the existing Why3 drivers for ReFlow.
\end{itemize}
